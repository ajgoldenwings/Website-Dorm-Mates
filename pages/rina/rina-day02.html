    <p>4). Create a table that ranks topics for the presidential race that is most important to you.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>5). In the grid system of presidential canidates put pictures for all of them. First find portraits of all of them. Put pictures in img folder. Use the img-circle tag.</p>
    <p>The results will look like this:</p>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Barack Obama<small> Democrat</small></h2>
                <img src="pages/rina/img/obama.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="Barack Obama" width="100%">

    <p>5). Jumbotron.  Have your jumbotron on top of your content and give it a title and some subtext of what you have done so far.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>6). For each presidential canidate, put them in a 'well' and 'well-sm' class. You may also try putting just their image in the well.  Whatever looks best.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>7). Create a Alert right below the Jumboton. Make sure it is the one that you can close. Put a news alert of the Presidential Race. Have it fade too.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>8). In this page look for a link that goes back to the index, '..back'.  Remove the '..' and make the back link into a button.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>9). Create a button group.  Have links for back 'index', Day 1, and Day 2.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>10). Create a Split Button Dropdowns aside to the botton group. Have the primary button be a link to 'http://www.politics1.com/p2016.htm'. Have the dropdown-menu be links to the list of your favorite presidential canidate's personal websites.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>11). Use a search glyphicon in the Split Button Dropdown for the primary to indicate that you are searching for canidates.</p>
