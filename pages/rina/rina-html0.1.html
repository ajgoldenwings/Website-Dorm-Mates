<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>You will be looking at 'HTML HOME', 'HTML Introduction', and 'HTML Basic'. Please look at the sections between.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>This is where you will be learning and entering in answers.</p>
<p>For instance. Please enter some information about yourself</p>
<p>What is your full name: Rina Namiwa</p>
<p>Why do you want to learn HTML? ENTERHERE</p>
<p>What does this 'p' tag thing mean you think? ENTERHERE</p>
<p>What does HTML stand for? ENTERHERE</p>
<p>Take a moment to look at this basic structure. Kind of looks like a text editor but has the markup as tags that surround text.</p>
<p>Do you have any questions for me.</p>

<h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
